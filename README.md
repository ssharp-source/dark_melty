Fork to mood drive, filtering and explore differnet HW targets

Goal to have a fork donen by the end of sept. to test by teh early part of Oct

If this turns into a massive rewrite the I might make a seperate repo and release it 

Whats differnet (I think)
-IF two wheels use them continuously (not just 180 to 350 degree) but "foward" bottome wheel positve from 180 to 0 and top wheel negative direction from 0 to 180. this should make a two wheeled version suuuuper fast
- Fir filter the IMU
- add external refernece (may be a bridge too far)
- target FPGA (looking at Intel ice family)
